Errors Faced During the Process:
Missing and Null Values:

Many rows in the dataset had missing age, height, or medal data.
Solution: Dropped rows with null values in critical fields.
KeyError for 'year':

The 'year' column was occasionally read incorrectly due to formatting.
Solution: Ensured 'year' was numeric by using pd.to_numeric.
Palette Errors in Seaborn:

Some color palettes were invalid (e.g., "gold").
Solution: Switched to valid palettes like YlOrBr, viridis, or coolwarm.
Inconsistent Column Names:

Column names differed across datasets.
Solution: Standardized column names to lowercase and stripped spaces.
Mismatch in NOC Codes:

Some NOC codes in the athlete events dataset did not match the NOC regions dataset.
Solution: Used a left join to avoid data loss but noted discrepancies.
Data Overlap in Seasons:

Misclassification of summer and winter sports in some cases.
Solution: Filtered explicitly by the 'season' column.
Visualization Overlaps:

Overlapping legends and labels in some graphs.
Solution: Used tight_layout() to adjust spacing.
